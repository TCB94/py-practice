# Sample Python Practice Code
Title says almost everything - it's just a sample code I made and practiced in Python.
# Requirements
While this code works on Python 3.10.6, I would recommend running this code on 3.0+.
# Downloading the code
Please check the "releases tab".
# Running the code
Just use  `py practice.py` or  `python practice.py` in your CMD, terminal, etc. to run the code.
